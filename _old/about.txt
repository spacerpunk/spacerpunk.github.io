ABOUT
Hello there! My name is Nicol√°s Requena AKA *Spacerpunk*
            
Learning the ins and outs of each software allowed me to understand different pipelines and device my own when a project needs a specific one! Every software can interact with one another and I enjoy finding ways for them to "speak" to each other.
    
I'm a Music Producer and Audio Engineer who learned to code and loves VFX. The means of entertainment are changing every day and I love to find new ways to work with that tech, VFX, 3D, AI, Music, sound and more.


Audio Tools: Pro Tools, Cubase, Reaper, Wwise, Pure Data.
VFX: After Effects, Premiere, Blender, C4D, Unreal Engine, Unity.
Java Script, Python, C++, Tidal Cylces, SuperCollider
    
Thank you!
